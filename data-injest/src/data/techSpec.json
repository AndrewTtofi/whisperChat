Usability: The interface should be user-friendly, with clear indications of how to input commands and responses. Security: User data should be securely stored, and all interactions should occur over secure protocols. User passwords should be securely hashed, and secure tokens should be used for session handling. Reliability: The system should provide consistent and reliable responses to user inputs. Scalability: The system should be scalable and capable of serving an increased number of users without performance issues."
